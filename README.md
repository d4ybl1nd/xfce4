Writting your own theme is a pain and it is too much of efforts. this is my personal xfce4 config and desktop env config based on Centos7 + xfce4. the gtk theme doesn't really cover yumex but i don't use yumex so i cannot care less. 
This might work only if you use centos7 + xfce4 but i haven't met anyone who uses those stack. just in case if you do, you might need to fiddle with display setting. This xfce4 config is for dual display. Display config isn't hard to fiddle with so should be rather straight forward.

## run.sh

The shell script will install compulsory packages but the gtk theme should be installed manually. 


## Recommended gtk theme

[Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme)

[Matcha: Arc variant](https://github.com/vinceliuice/matcha) 

Most of dark themes are outdated and not really competible on gtk3+xfce :(

## Icon theme

[paper-icon-theme.noarch rpm info](https://www.rpmfind.net/linux/RPM/epel/7/ppc64le/Packages/p/paper-icon-theme-1.4.0-2.el7.noarch.html)

## xfce4 additional keybindings

`super + g: ` **guake** 

`super + v: ` **vscode**

`super + r: ` **xfce4-appfinder**

`super + l: ` **xfce4-session-logout**

`ctrl + alt + f:` **thunar**

That's it. no craziness.
